Property,Metric,Definition / Rationale,Sub-questions for RAG retrieval,1–5 Rubric Anchor (summary)
1,Problem & Market Need,"Tests whether a clear, focused narrative presents a sizable, urgent pain, backed by evidence and a unique market insight.","• What pain points are named and for whom?
• Is urgency or frequency quantified (cost, time, risk)?
• Is the need supported by data, customer quotes, or spend figures?
• Do founders present a unique or contrarian market insight?
• Does the problem narrative stay consistent across the tagline and the deck?","1 = Vague problem, no data.
3 = Clear pain with anecdotal proof.
5 = Critical, quantified pain with hard evidence + unique insight + coherent story."
2,Solution & Value Proposition,"Evaluates how concretely the product solves the pain, how intuitive the value prop is, and whether the solution is defensible.","• Does the product workflow map directly to the pain points?
• Is the value proposition clear and concrete (specific benefit)?
• Is there a functional product or convincing prototype in market?
• Is the solution defensible / hard to replicate (tech, data, IP, network)?","1 = Unclear solution or vague benefit.
3 = Logical fit, clear proposition, some proof points.
5 = Crystal-clear benefit + live proof + clear moat."
3,Market Size & Capture Strategy,"Combines TAM/SAM realism, GTM plan, and competitive landscape—i.e., can they win a big enough slice?","• Are TAM, SAM, and SOM broken down with sources?
• Is the initial target segment actionable?
• Is competition mapped and a differentiated wedge stated?
• Is the GTM / CAC vs. LTV (or proxy) discussed or quantified?","1 = Hand-wavy “1% of huge market.”
3 = Basic segmentation + GTM sketch.
5 = Data-backed sizing, clear beach-head, differentiated wedge, credible CAC/LTV."
4,Traction & Business Model Viability,"Looks for demand proof and a scalable, feasible path to revenue and customer acquisition.","• What hard traction metrics (users, revenue, pilots) are disclosed?
• Are growth curves tied to a repeatable acquisition channel?
• Is CAC vs. LTV (or a realistic proxy) quantified or trending favourably?
• Is there a clear customer-acquisition strategy embedded in the model?","1 = No traction, unclear model.
3 = Early signals + basic pricing.
5 = Strong growth/retention, validated unit economics, explicit acquisition engine."
5,Team & Execution Capability,"Assesses founder–market fit, relevant experience, and ability to hire and execute.","• Do backgrounds match domain and tech needs?
• Any prior exits, patents, or deep-tech creds?
• Is motivation linked to success drivers?
• Are key talent gaps acknowledged with a hiring plan?","1 = Misaligned team.
3 = Reasonable fit, some gaps.
5 = Uniquely qualified or repeat performers with clear roadmap."
6,Investment Ask & Vision,"Judges whether the raise, milestone plan, and long-term vision warrant a VC bet.","• How much capital is requested at this stage?
• Are use-of-funds tied to concrete milestones/KPIs?
• Is the vision large enough for venture-scale returns and time-aligned?
• Are valuation and timeline expectations realistic?","1 = Unrealistic ask or vague spend plan.
3 = Reasonable ask + milestone list.
5 = Well-calibrated ask, KPI-driven, inspiring long-term upside."
